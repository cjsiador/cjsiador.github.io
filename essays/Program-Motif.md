Long ago in 1994, there were four authors who were inspired to make a book together. They created a book that became well known and important to programming. They were called the “Gang of Four”. In their book called “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”, it introduced a new concept that revolutionized programming - the concept of design patterns. Applying design patterns is a way to help other programmers to understand the code itself, allowing it to make it easier to read it and program without reinventing the wheel. This concept is new to me, however, throughout my experience in programming, I’ve been using some of the design patterns without acknowledging that it was a design pattern. 

There are multiple design patterns that can be beneficial to be utilized. However, there could be times where it has its own pros and cons, or it is an anti-patterns. To name a few design patterns, some of the popular ones are factory, singleton, observer, and MVC. There are more design patterns, but let start with these four designs first. Factory returns subclasses and its object, which is polymorphic programming, but one of the disadvantages is that it can complicate things by increasing the number of classes. A singleton is the easiest way to implement that uses a global variable in the program. However, singleton is an anti-pattern that may be unnecessary and the disadvantages is that it’s not normally thread-safe, meaning that other instances can exist at the same time, which could cause conflicts in the program. An observer design is implementing a one-to-many relationship, where each object contains their own key that records in a different table. A disadvantage of using this design pattern is that it can be harder to debug because it can complicate things to understand the code. Model-View-Controller, or MVC is a design that interacts with the user interface and the program. Model would be something that interacts with the database and changes it based on what the program intended to do and connects with the controller. The view is the UI, what people see and can pass values from the controller, such as inputting your login information and it views a different page that only you can view. The controller is what gathers data from the model and then passes it to the view. It also receives input from the view. 

Learning these new design patterns made me realize that I’ve been using these designs before, and the most commonly used design that I used was the singleton design and MVC. When I was programming a C/C++ project, I often used the singleton design because I found it easier to implement. As for implementing MVC, we created a website that involves logging in and roles that allows different users with the specific role on what they can view, or not. Now that I know more in-depth about this concept, I can now use some of these designs and know which one to avoid, unless otherwise it’s necessary.
